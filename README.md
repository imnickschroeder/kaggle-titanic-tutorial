# kaggle-titanic-tutorial
The code that goes along with the Titanic data set tutorial from Trevor Stephens (http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/). There is also some code from Megan Risdal's kaggle kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic).
